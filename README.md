# An Stock Market Sharing App

## Overview

###How It Works
Add stocks and receive updates based on the current month. Friends can open up a new window and they will see the stocks that you have displayed.
This functions using web sockets courtesy of socket.io.
  
###Example usage:
Enter AAPL, MSFT, and M to get a comparison of three different companies. Then add or delete as you wish.
